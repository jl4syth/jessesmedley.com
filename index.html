                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I am a California girl to core. I spent the first ten years of my adult life working in sports medicine. Eventually I was exhausted and burnt out working 60-80 hours a week, so I began to look for a change. I came across coding and web design and remembered how much I loved it in my first computer science course at the age of 12. I signed up for my first class that week!</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>When I learned to build my first website it quickly became obvious that tech and web design was my ticket to the change in life that I wanted. Now I spend my days working to live instead of living to work. I enjoy helping others find the changes in life that they need in order to live it to the fullest and find their success.</p>

                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
